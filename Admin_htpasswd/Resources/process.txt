weak passwd
Process:
    - Check robots.txt
    - Go to /whatever
    - Download httpasswd => (root:437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49)
    - Decrypt (md5) (437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49 = qwerty123@)
    - Go to /admin
    - Use root and qwerty123@
    - Get the flag

Secure:
    - Make sure the /admin page is denied by client user (and all the other sensitive page)
    - Config file in web server (exemple nginx : /admin {
                                                    redirect 404
                                                  })
    - Use Cryptographic tools more advanced (bcrypt)
    - Use a strong password
